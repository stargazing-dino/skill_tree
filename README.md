A package to build skill trees of any kind. This package differs from `graphview` as it only tries to provide users an interface to make a skill tree rather than a general purpose graph viewer.

## Simple usage

```dart
class Home extends StatelessWidget {
  const Home({ Key? key }) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SkillTree<void, void>(
      delegate: LayeredTreeDelegate(
        mainAxisSpacing: 32.0,
        crossAxisSpacing: 48.0,
        layout: [
          ['0', '1', '2', null],
          ['3', '4', '5', null],
          ['6', '7', '8', null],
          [null, '9', '10', null],
          ['11', '12', null, '13'],
          [null, null, '14', null],
          [null, '15', '16', null],
        ],
      ),
      edges: [
        Edge(from: '7', to: '9'),
        Edge(from: '10', to: '14'),
        Edge(from: '12', to: '15'),
      ],
      nodes: [
        Node(id: '0'),
        Node(id: '1'),
        Node(id: '2'),
        Node(id: '3'),
        Node(id: '4'),
        Node(id: '5'),
        Node(id: '6'),
        Node(id: '7'),
        Node(id: '8'),
        Node(id: '9'),
        Node(id: '10'),
        Node(id: '11'),
        Node(id: '12'),
        Node(id: '13'),
        Node(id: '14'),
        Node(id: '15'),
        Node(id: '16'),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

Say you want to store information on the node that is specific to your application. For example, the MP it costs to fire that skill. For this, you can provide a map or data class to hold your custom data. To do this, you'll also need to provide a custom serializer and deserializer. 

```dart
class MyData {
  const MyData(this.cost);

  final int cost;
}

class Home extends StatelessWidget {
  const Home({ Key? key }) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // The first data type is the data type of the node. The second is
    // of the edge. The last data type is the type of the id.
    return SkillTree<MyData, void, String>(
      serializeNode: (MyData myData) {
        return myData.toJson(myData);
      },
      deserializeNode: (Map<String, dynamic> json) {
        return myData.fromJson(json);
      },
      // ...
    );
  }
}
```

Now that you have your MP on the node you can render it how you like by providing a nodeBuilder. It will receive the node and your data.

```dart
nodeBuilder: (node) {
  return SkillNode.fromNode(
    node: node,
    child: Column(
      children: [
        Text(node.name),
        Text('MP cost: ${node.data.cost}'),
      ],
    ),
  );
},
```

That's pretty shweet right? Notice the `SkillNode` though? That's because you have the option to insert `SkillNode`s inside of the nodes field directly and define your children that way. The same is possible with `SkillEdge`.

```dart
SkillTree<void, void>(
  nodes: [
    SkillNode(id: '0', child: Container()),
    // ...
  ],
),
```

Another feature users usually want with their skill trees are points and points to acqure functionality. A node usually has a `cost` associated with it to unlock. For that, you can provide a `requirement` to your `SkillNode` and a `value` to your `SkillTree`. Note, everything defined on a `SkillTree` is automatically deserialized for you excluding the `data`. With that information, you can decide on whether your node is locked or unlocked.

```dart
class Home extends StatelessWidget {
  const Home({ Key? key }) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SkillTree<void, void>(
      value: 5,
      maxValue: 20,
      delegate: LayeredTreeDelegate(),
      edges: [
        Edge(from: '0', to: '1'),
        Edge(from: '0', to: '2'),
      ],
      nodes: [
        // TODO: I need an assertion in the graph that checks a SkillNode has a
        // smaller requirement than its descendant. Throw [GraphException].
        SkillNode(id: '0', child: MyChild(), requirement: 1),
        SkillNode(id: '1', child: MyChild(), requirement: 10),
        SkillNode(id: '2', child: MyChild(), requirement: 15),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

# But muh customizability !

`skill_tree` provides a theme called `SkillTreeThemeData` that you can modify as you like. If none is provided, a default is created that takes values from your app's default `ThemeData`.

Custom edges can even be drawn by providing an `edgePainter` to either a `SkillTree` or a `SkillEdge`.

# Help me

I'm not very good with graphs. I'd love to have fancy algorithms that draw both the nodes and edges but I think I'll need support for that.

Ways to help:

* Open an issue with an example of a skill tree and a rough sketch of how it'd be accomplished. We can start with two things. How the `graph` representation would look like and how a `layout` algorithm would roughly work. You don't have to be exact.
* Improve on my definition of a graph and its subtypes.
* Provide a better interface for managing the graph. This could be writing me some generic algorithms like depthFirstSearh or whatever.
* Every TODO: is free game but are likely related to low level Flutter rendering
